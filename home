            <p>
                My name is Josh Mushinski.
                I am originally from Livonia, Michigan where I went to Churchill High School.
                I now live over on the west side of the state in the Grand Rapids area.
                This is my senior year of college and afterwards I plan on going to graduate school to become a
                psychometrician.
            </p>

            <h3>My interests</h3>

            <p>
                Video games are one of my interests.
                I have been playing video games all of my life.
                I love playing video games of any genres.
                For me, video games are a great way to relieve stress and also to hang out with friends.
                My favorite genre of video games is single player open world games.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another one of my interests is watchign movies.
                Sometimes I will watch one or two new movies a week.
                I love movies because they can make you feel a wide range of emotion and they can expand my imagination.
            </p>

            <h3>My pets</h3>

            <p>
                Pets have always been a big part of my life.
                Growing up I had dogs, cats, fish, and bunnies.
                Pets are great because the bonds you form with them is invaluable and their ability to make you happy
                when you are feeling down is incredible.
                Currently, I own two dogs and a cat.
            </p>
