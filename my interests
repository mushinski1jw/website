                My favorite video game is Borderlands two. The gameplay is really fun and the game itself has a ton of
                replayability.
                If you are a fan of role playing games, then you might like this game. There is a large variety of loot
                to collect.
                Also, there are six different playable characters each with their own unique skill trees and special
                abilities.
                This game is fun to play with friends or alone. While the story is pretty simply, the main villain of
                the game is very memorable. <img

            <p>I have watched a ton of movies over the years, but my favorite movie of all time is Casino Royale.
                This is a James Bond movie and it is actor Daniel Craig's first time playing the character James Bond.
                I am a huge James Bond fan and I have seen each movie at least two times.
                What makes Casino Royale so special is that it is the first Bond film to really give the character an
                origin story.
                Daniel Craig does a great job of conveying Bond's emotions and vuneralbility.
                In addition to the portrayal of the character, the action really stands out for me.
                This movie has the least amount of action of any Bond film, but the action it does have is very intense.
