            <h2>My pets</h2>

            <p> My one dog is Daisy and she is a maltese and yorkie mix. She is five years old and is not the brightest
                dog.
                She is known for running into doors and walls. What she lacks in brains she makes up for in energy. She
                loves playing fetch and tug of war.
                She loves chasing any animals that wander into our backyard.
                My other dog is Marley and she is a tiny chocolate yorkie.
                She only weighs about five pounds and has the complete opposite temperment of Daisy. Marley enjoys
                spending her time sleeping in someone's lap.
                She barely barks and does not care about animals being in our yard. What makes Marley special is her
                intelligence.
                My family never really trained her, but she knows basic commands and we can take her for a walk without
                a leash. <img src="dog.jpeg" alt="Daisy and Marley" /> </p>

            <p> My cat is named Hibiscus and she is a small black cat. Hibiscus loves catnip and is a very timid cat.
                She loves being pet by people she knows and runs away from people she does not know. Hibiscus is not the
                biggest fan of other animals, yet she is able to tolerate dogs.
                Often times you can find Hibiscus sleeping up in her cat tree. <img src="cat.jpeg" alt="Hibiscus" /></p>
